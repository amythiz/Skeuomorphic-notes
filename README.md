# Skeuomorphic-notes
Skeuomorphic Notes is a nostalgic handwritten notes app inspired by iOS 5, built in Python (Tkinter) with MySQL for filename suggestions. I created it for my Grade 12 CS project after rediscovering my old 2009 iPad and wanting to recreate a small piece of that skeuomorphic era, which happened to be my childhood. A more detailed README in the folder.
